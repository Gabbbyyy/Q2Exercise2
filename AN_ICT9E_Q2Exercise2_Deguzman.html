	<p>It was just two lovers</p>
	<p>Sittin' in the car, listening to Blonde</p>
	<p>Fallin' for each other</p>
	<p>Pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish</p>
	<p>No Donald Glover</p>
	<p>Missed call from my mother</p>
	<p>Like, "Where you at tonight?" Got no alibi</p><br>

	<p>I was all alone with the love of my life</p>
	<p>She's got glitter for skin</p>
	<p>My radiant beam in the night</p>
	<p>I don't need no light to see you</p><br>

	<p><span>Shine</span></p>
	<p>It's your golden hour (oh)</p>
	<p>You slow down time</p>
	<p>In your golden hour (oh)</p><br>

	<p>We were just two lovers</p>
	<p>Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast</p>
	<p>Burnin' through the summer</p>
	<p>Radio on blast, make the moment last</p>
	<p>She got solar power</p>
	<p>Minutes feel like hours</p>
	<p>She knew she was the baddest, can you even imagine</p>
	<p>Fallin' like I did?</p><br>

	<p>For the love of my life</p>
	<p>She's got glow on her face</p>
	<p>A glorious look in her eyes</p>
	<p>My angel of light</p><br>

	<p>I was all alone with the love of my life</p>
	<p>She's got glitter for skin</p>
	<p>My radiant beam in the night</p>
	<p>I don't need no light to see you</p><br>

	<p><span>Shine</span></p>
	<p>It's your golden hour <div>(oh)</div></p>
	<p>You slow down time</p>
	<p>In your golden hour <div>(oh)</div></p><br>
